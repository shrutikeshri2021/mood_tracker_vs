## 🏗️ Architecture & How It Works

MoodVS is built as a **Privacy-First Progressive Web App (PWA)**. Its architecture is designed to handle complex mental health logic entirely on the client-side, ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the user's device.

### 🧠 Logic Engines (The "Brains")
- **Burnout Engine (`burnoutEngine.ts`)**: Uses a weighted scoring algorithm to calculate burnout risk (0-100) by analyzing cross-referenced data between stress levels, energy, sleep, and workload.
- **Pattern Detector (`patternDetector.ts`)**: Iterates through historical entries to identify correlations (e.g., "Mondays with high stress correlate with 'meeting' tags").
- **Mood Forecast (`moodForecast.ts`)**: A predictive model that identifies cyclical trends to warn users about potential "low" days before they happen.
- **Balance Scorer (`balanceScore.ts`)**: Calculates a holistic "Emotional Balance" percentage based on the harmony between different wellness metrics.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security Infrastructure
- **Zero-Server Storage**: Uses `localStorage` via a dedicated `storage.ts` service.
- **Encryption**: Employs **AES-256 encryption** (via `crypto-js`) for sensitive journal entries, meaning even if someone gains access to the device's browser data, the thoughts remain unreadable.
- **Panic Mode**: A unique architectural "cloak" that wraps the entire application state. When triggered, it replaces the UI with a fully functional Calculator, hiding the mental health data behind a secret PIN.

### 📡 APIs & System Services
- **Web Speech API**: Powering the "Voice Journal" feature, allowing users to speak their thoughts which are then transcribed and sentiment-analyzed in real-time.
- **Web Notifications API**: Managed by `notificationService.ts` to provide gentle, non-intrusive reminders for daily check-ins and breathing sessions.
- **Web Audio API**: Utilized by `audioTherapy.ts` and `systemSounds.ts` for low-latency playback of binaural beats and therapeutic soundscapes.
